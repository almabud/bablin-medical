\section{Pneumo-peritoneum in laparoscopy (January, 2009)}

\textbf{Question:} Describe pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopy.

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Pneumoperitoneum is created by insufflating gas into the abdominal cavity to provide working space for minimally invasive surgery. Bailey & Love describes it as the fundamental first step that allows visualization of intra-abdominal organs while minimizing trauma. Carbon dioxide is the preferred gas because it is highly soluble in blood, non-combustible, and easily removed by ventilation.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} Establishment of pneumoperitoneum can be achieved using a Veress needle or an open technique such as Hasson entry. The initial insufflation pressure is usually set between 12 and 15 mmHg to create adequate space while limiting cardiovascular compromise. Higher pressures can impede venous return, elevate systemic vascular resistance, and increase airway pressure, so anesthetic monitoring is crucial. Surgeons must be cautious to avoid visceral or vascular injury when placing the first trocar. Complications include subcutaneous emphysema, gas embolism, and unrecognized bowel perforation. Patients with previous abdominal surgery may require optical trocars or an open approach due to adhesions. Physiological effects extend beyond the cardiovascular system; elevated intra-abdominal pressure reduces renal perfusion and affects diaphragmatic motion, potentially increasing the risk of postoperative atelectasis. Alternative methods such as gasless laparoscopy using abdominal wall lifting devices exist, but they are less common. Modern insufflators can regulate pressure and flow more precisely and incorporate smoke evacuation to maintain visibility. Appropriate patient positioning—Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg—helps optimize exposure but can further alter venous return and respiratory mechanics.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
\emph{Evidence Base:} Recommendations align with Bailey & Love and related references.

\emph{Conclusion:} Proficiency in establishing and managing pneumoperitoneum is essential for safe laparoscopy. Understanding its physiological impact, carefully selecting the access technique, and close coordination with anesthesia minimize risks. When employed correctly, pneumoperitoneum enables surgeons to perform a wide range of procedures through small incisions, resulting in less postoperative pain, shorter hospitalization, and quicker recovery compared with traditional open surgery.


\section{Bipolar diathermy (January, 2009)}

\textbf{Question:} What is bipolar diathermy and how is it used?

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Bipolar diathermy utilizes an electrosurgical forceps through which current passes between two closely spaced tips. Unlike the monopolar system where current travels through the patient to a return plate, bipolar current is confined to tissue held between the prongs, allowing precise coagulation. Bailey & Love recommends bipolar devices when operating near delicate structures because the limited current path minimizes unintended thermal injury.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} The technology works by generating radiofrequency energy that causes ionic agitation and heating of tissue, leading to protein denaturation and vessel sealing. It is particularly useful in neurosurgery, ophthalmic surgery, and procedures around major nerves or vessels where precision is paramount. Because the current does not traverse the whole body, there is no need for a grounding pad, reducing the risk of burns at remote sites. Surgeons must ensure the tips are clean and dry to obtain efficient coagulation. Settings vary depending on tissue type—higher power may be required for fatty tissue compared with vascular structures. Modern bipolar units may incorporate feedback systems to deliver just enough energy to achieve hemostasis without excessive charring. Complications are rare but can include thermal spread if high power is used or if activation is prolonged. The surgeon should avoid activating the instrument near flammable gases, as with all electrosurgery. Regular equipment checks and maintenance are essential, including inspecting insulation to prevent stray currents. Foot pedal or hand controls allow momentary activation, giving surgeons tactile feedback and improved safety.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
\emph{Evidence Base:} Recommendations align with Bailey & Love and related references.

\emph{Conclusion:} Bipolar diathermy provides precise, localized coagulation with reduced risk of collateral damage compared to monopolar techniques. When used with proper settings and attention to safety protocols, it is an invaluable tool for achieving hemostasis in areas where protecting surrounding tissue is critical.

\section{Brachytherapy (January, 2011)}

\textbf{Question:} Discuss brachytherapy.

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Brachytherapy is a form of internal radiation therapy where radioactive sources are positioned within or near the tumor, concentrating dose on malignant tissue.

\emph{Definition and Types:} Techniques include intracavitary, interstitial, and surface applications using temporary or permanent implants with low- or high-dose rates.

\emph{Indications:} It treats localized cancers such as cervical, prostate, breast, and selected head and neck tumors.

\emph{Technique:} Under imaging guidance, applicators or needles are placed into the tumor and loaded with isotopes like iridium-192 or iodine-125 for a prescribed time. Treatment planning optimizes dose distribution.

\emph{Advantages:} Localized delivery permits higher radiation doses with minimal exposure to surrounding organs, shortening overall treatment duration.

\emph{Complications:} Potential problems include tissue necrosis, ulceration, fistula formation, strictures, or rarely secondary malignancies.

\emph{Postoperative care:} Analgesia, monitoring of insertion sites, and radiation safety precautions are needed until sources are removed or decay. Regular follow-up assesses response and late effects.

\emph{Evidence Base:} Randomized trials demonstrate improved control and survival in gynecologic and prostate cancers when brachytherapy complements external beam radiotherapy.

\emph{Conclusion:} With careful planning and specialist expertise, brachytherapy offers effective, organ-sparing therapy for many localized cancers.

\section{Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (January, 2009)}

\textbf{Question:} What is disseminated intravascular coagulation and how is it managed?

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a pathological process in which widespread activation of the coagulation cascade leads to intravascular fibrin deposition and consumption of platelets and clotting factors. Bailey & Love emphasizes that DIC is not a primary disease but a complication of severe conditions such as trauma, sepsis, or obstetric catastrophe. Early recognition is vital because DIC can rapidly progress to multiorgan failure.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} The underlying trigger for DIC is the release of procoagulant substances into the bloodstream, often due to tissue damage or infection. This causes extensive microvascular thrombosis, leading to ischemia and organ dysfunction. Concurrently, the consumption of clotting factors and platelets results in bleeding from surgical sites, mucous membranes, or puncture wounds. Laboratory findings include prolonged prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, low fibrinogen levels, and elevated D-dimer. Management begins with aggressive treatment of the precipitating condition: controlling infection, draining abscesses, or removing necrotic tissue. Supportive care includes maintaining hemodynamic stability, optimizing oxygenation, and replacing depleted coagulation factors with fresh-frozen plasma and platelets. Cryoprecipitate may be required for very low fibrinogen levels. Heparin therapy is controversial; it may be considered in cases dominated by thrombosis rather than bleeding, but its use should be individualized. Monitoring trends in laboratory parameters guides therapy. In critically ill patients, admission to intensive care allows continuous observation of organ function. Replacement therapy should be titrated to clinical and laboratory response.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
\emph{Evidence Base:} Recommendations align with Bailey & Love and related references.

\emph{Conclusion:} DIC requires prompt diagnosis and a multifaceted approach targeting the underlying cause while supporting coagulation. Timely intervention can prevent catastrophic bleeding or irreversible organ damage. A high index of suspicion, particularly in high-risk settings like trauma and sepsis, allows surgeons to initiate treatment early and improve patient outcomes.


\section{Pressure sore (July, 2008)}

\textbf{Question:} Discuss pressure sores and their management.

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Pressure sores, also called decubitus ulcers, arise when prolonged pressure over bony prominences leads to ischemia and subsequent tissue breakdown. They are common in bedridden or neurologically impaired patients. Bailey & Love highlights the importance of prevention, as established ulcers can be difficult to heal and may predispose patients to infection and prolonged hospitalization.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} The pathogenesis involves sustained external pressure exceeding capillary perfusion pressure, leading to local ischemia. Shear forces, friction, and moisture from incontinence exacerbate tissue damage. Staging ranges from nonblanching erythema to deep ulcers exposing muscle or bone. Management begins with identifying at-risk patients, such as those with spinal cord injury, advanced age, or malnutrition. Preventive measures include frequent repositioning—ideally every two hours—use of pressure-relieving mattresses, and meticulous skin care. Once a sore develops, treatment depends on depth. Superficial ulcers may respond to offloading pressure, absorbent dressings, and topical agents. Deeper wounds often require debridement of necrotic tissue, management of infection with antibiotics, and optimization of nutrition, particularly protein and vitamins. Vacuum-assisted closure can help promote granulation. Surgical options, such as flap coverage, may be considered for chronic stage III or IV ulcers when conservative measures fail. Multidisciplinary involvement of nursing staff, physiotherapists, dietitians, and wound specialists is essential. Regular assessment with wound measurements and photographic documentation monitors progress. Pain control should not be neglected, as ulcer care can be uncomfortable.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
\emph{Evidence Base:} Recommendations align with Bailey & Love and related references.

\emph{Conclusion:} Prevention remains the cornerstone in managing pressure sores. Early recognition of risk factors, diligent nursing care, and appropriate use of support surfaces can avert these often devastating lesions. When ulcers do occur, a structured approach that addresses pressure relief, wound care, infection control, and nutritional support offers the best chance of healing and reduces the risk of recurrence.


\section{Multiple discharging sinus in axilla (July, 2008)}

\textbf{Question:} Explain the causes and treatment of multiple discharging sinuses in the axilla.

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Multiple sinuses in the axillary region are most often caused by chronic inflammatory disorders of apocrine sweat glands, particularly hidradenitis suppurativa. Bailey & Love notes that early diagnosis and appropriate management are necessary to prevent extensive scarring and functional limitation in this anatomically complex area.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} Hidradenitis suppurativa begins with occlusion of hair follicles, leading to recurrent abscess formation. With repeated inflammation, sinus tracts develop and may connect beneath the skin, creating multiple discharging openings. Contributing factors include obesity, smoking, tight clothing, and sometimes a genetic predisposition. Acute flares may be managed with antibiotics such as tetracycline or clindamycin, combined with improved hygiene and avoidance of irritants. Chronic disease with sinus formation often requires surgical intervention. Limited excision of sinus tracts can be effective in early stages, while wide local excision of affected skin and subcutaneous tissue may be indicated for advanced disease. Reconstruction can involve split-thickness skin grafts or local flaps. Newer treatments, including laser hair removal, biological agents, and lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and smoking cessation, may reduce recurrence. It is important to differentiate hidradenitis from other causes of axillary sinuses, such as tuberculosis, actinomycosis, or metastatic lymph node disease, which require specific therapy. Histological examination of excised tissue helps rule out malignancy that can rarely arise in chronic lesions.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
\emph{Evidence Base:} Recommendations align with Bailey & Love and related references.

\emph{Conclusion:} Multiple axillary sinuses are most commonly due to hidradenitis suppurativa. Effective treatment combines medical therapy for acute inflammation with surgical excision for chronic, scarred disease. Early recognition and comprehensive management can significantly improve quality of life and limit disability.


\section{Necrotizing fasciitis (July, 2008)}

\textbf{Question:} What is necrotizing fasciitis and how is it managed?

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection characterized by widespread necrosis of the fascia and subcutaneous tissues. Bailey & Love identifies it as a surgical emergency that can quickly lead to systemic toxicity and death if not promptly diagnosed and treated. Early symptoms may be deceptively mild, making vigilance essential.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} The condition is often classified into Type I, a polymicrobial infection involving aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and Type II, typically caused by group A Streptococcus. Predisposing factors include diabetes, immunosuppression, chronic kidney disease, and minor trauma or surgery. Clinical features include severe pain disproportionate to physical findings, swelling, erythema, and skin discoloration. Crepitus may be present if gas-forming organisms are involved. Imaging with CT or MRI can reveal fascial thickening and gas, aiding diagnosis, but treatment should not be delayed for imaging if clinical suspicion is high. Management demands immediate, aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue, often requiring repeated operations. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics covering Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms are essential; regimens may include penicillin, clindamycin, and a third-generation cephalosporin. Supportive care in an intensive care unit addresses septic shock and organ dysfunction. Adjunctive therapies, such as hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous immunoglobulin, have been used but with variable evidence. After infection control, reconstructive surgery may be needed for extensive tissue loss.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
\emph{Evidence Base:} Recommendations align with Bailey & Love and related references.

\emph{Conclusion:} Rapid recognition and prompt surgical intervention, combined with broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive support, are vital to survival in necrotizing fasciitis.

\section{Sentinel node (July, 2008)}

\textbf{Question:} Define a sentinel lymph node and its role in cancer surgery.

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} A sentinel lymph node is the initial lymph node or group of nodes that receives lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor site. The concept, highlighted in both Bailey & Love and modern oncologic textbooks, underpins the minimally invasive approach to staging many cancers. By analyzing the sentinel node, surgeons can determine whether metastasis has occurred without performing extensive nodal dissection.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} Sentinel node mapping is commonly used in breast cancer and melanoma surgery but has applications in other cancers, such as vulvar carcinoma. The procedure involves injecting a tracer—either a blue dye, a radioactive colloid, or both—around the tumor or biopsy site. Lymphatic channels transport the tracer to the sentinel node, which is identified intraoperatively with a gamma probe or by visualizing blue staining. This node is removed and sent for immediate pathological examination using frozen section or subsequently with standard histology and immunohistochemistry. If metastatic cells are detected, further nodal clearance or adjuvant therapy may be indicated. Conversely, if the sentinel node is negative, the patient can avoid the morbidity associated with complete lymph node dissection, such as lymphedema, nerve injury, and prolonged wound healing. Accuracy depends on meticulous technique and anatomical understanding of lymphatic drainage patterns. False negatives can occur if the tracer bypasses a diseased or obstructed node or if multiple lymphatic basins are involved. Training and multidisciplinary cooperation between surgeons, nuclear medicine physicians, and pathologists enhance success rates.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
\emph{Evidence Base:} Recommendations align with Bailey & Love and related references.

\emph{Conclusion:} Sentinel node biopsy is a valuable tool for staging and guiding treatment in many cancers. By focusing on the first draining node, surgeons can obtain crucial prognostic information while sparing patients the complications of more radical surgery when it is not necessary.


\section{Problems of surgery in an obese patient (January, 2008)}

\textbf{Question:} Enumerate the problems associated with operating on an obese patient.

\textbf{Answer}

\emph{Introduction:} Obesity is a growing health issue worldwide and presents unique challenges in the perioperative period. Bailey & Love notes that obesity complicates nearly every aspect of surgical care, from airway management to postoperative recovery. Understanding these challenges allows the surgical team to plan appropriately and mitigate risks.
\emph{Definition and Types:} Standard descriptions are provided in surgical texts.
\emph{Indications:} Refer to common indications relevant to this topic.

\emph{Technique:} Preoperatively, obese patients often have associated comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea, which increase perioperative risk. Anesthetic induction may be difficult due to limited neck mobility and excess soft tissue, making airway management challenging. Venous access can be problematic, and patient positioning requires additional care to prevent nerve compression and pressure injuries. Intraoperatively, thick adipose layers obscure anatomical landmarks, prolonging surgical time and potentially increasing blood loss. Laparoscopic procedures may require higher insufflation pressures and longer instruments. Obesity also predisposes to thromboembolic events, so careful prophylaxis with compression stockings and pharmacologic anticoagulation is essential. Postoperatively, wound complications such as infection, dehiscence, and incisional hernia are more common due to poor vascularity of adipose tissue and increased tension on suture lines. Respiratory complications are heightened because decreased lung volumes and obstructive sleep apnea lead to hypoventilation and atelectasis. Mobilization is often delayed, exacerbating risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Dosing of medications, particularly anesthetics and antibiotics, must consider ideal versus total body weight. Specialized bariatric equipment, including wide operating tables, longer retractors, and imaging devices, may be required.
\emph{Advantages:} Key benefits include effective outcomes when applied correctly.
\emph{Complications:} Potential complications depend on patient factors and technique.
\emph{Postoperative care:} Standard postoperative monitoring and follow-up are advised.
