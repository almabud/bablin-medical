# MCPS Surgery Revision Flashcards

This document answers common short-note questions from **Bailey & Love's Short Practice of Surgery** and other standard texts. Each entry provides a brief introduction, key points, and a concluding remark to help consolidate knowledge for exam revision.


1. **Pneumo-peritoneum in laparoscopy (January, 2009)**
**Question:** Describe pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopy.
**Answer**
*Introduction:* Pneumoperitoneum is the creation of an artificial space within the abdominal cavity by insufflating gas. According to Bailey & Love, it is the key preliminary step in laparoscopic surgery, providing safe visualization and room for instrument manipulation. Carbon dioxide is favored for insufflation because it is readily soluble, non-flammable, and easily cleared by the respiratory system.
*Main Content:* Establishing pneumoperitoneum can be done with a closed Veress needle or an open Hasson approach. The usual target pressure of 12-15 mmHg provides adequate space while limiting hemodynamic effects. Increased intra-abdominal pressure reduces venous return and raises systemic resistance, so anesthetic monitoring of blood pressure and end-tidal CO₂ is essential. Complications to watch for include visceral or vascular injury during entry, subcutaneous emphysema, and rarely gas embolism or pneumothorax. Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg positioning may improve exposure but further affects venous return and lung mechanics. CO₂ insufflation is generally well tolerated, but patients with cardiopulmonary disease may require special caution. Newer insufflators allow low-flow techniques with smoke evacuation that reduce postoperative shoulder tip pain. Alternative methods such as mechanical abdominal wall lifting exist but are less common.
Preoperative evaluation should take prior abdominal operations into account; scarring may necessitate open entry or optical trocars to avoid injury.
*Conclusion:* Mastery of pneumoperitoneum requires understanding physiological effects, choosing the appropriate access technique, and close cooperation with anesthesia to monitor cardiorespiratory parameters. When performed safely, it permits minimally invasive operations that offer patients reduced postoperative pain, smaller scars, and quicker recovery compared with open surgery. Surgeons must remain alert to early signs of hemodynamic compromise and be ready to convert to an open approach if safe visualization cannot be maintained.





2. **Bipolar diathermy (January, 2009)**

**Question:** What is bipolar diathermy and how is it used?

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Bipolar diathermy is an electrosurgical technique in which electrical current passes between two tips of a forceps-like instrument, producing heat that coagulates tissue. It is recommended in Bailey & Love for precise haemostasis near delicate structures.

*Main Content:* Unlike monopolar diathermy, bipolar systems confine current to the tissue grasped between the tips, reducing collateral damage and eliminating the need for a patient return electrode. It is especially useful in neurosurgery, ENT procedures, and operations near nerves or vessels. The device allows coagulation of small vessels with minimal thermal spread, decreasing risk of burns or arrhythmia. Surgeons must ensure the field is dry and avoid using bipolar in the presence of flammable gases. Equipment checks and foot pedal control help maintain safety.
*Conclusion:* Bipolar diathermy offers targeted coagulation with reduced risks compared to monopolar devices, making it invaluable for surgery close to vital structures.
**Answer**

*Introduction:* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic process in which widespread activation of clotting leads to consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. Bailey & Love highlights DIC as a grave complication of trauma, sepsis, or obstetric emergencies.

*Main Content:* In DIC, microthrombi form throughout the vasculature, causing organ ischemia while the depletion of clotting factors leads to bleeding. Laboratory findings include prolonged PT and aPTT, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimers. Management centers on treating the underlying cause—such as controlling infection or removing necrotic tissue—and supportive care. Transfusion of platelets and fresh-frozen plasma may be required to correct coagulopathy. In some cases, heparin is used to reduce thrombotic burden, though this remains controversial and patient specific.

*Conclusion:* Early recognition and targeted therapy of the precipitating condition are crucial for controlling DIC and improving outcomes.


4. **Pressure sore (July, 2008)**

**Question:** Discuss pressure sores and their management.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Pressure sores, also known as decubitus ulcers, occur when prolonged pressure over bony prominences leads to ischemia and tissue necrosis. They remain a significant challenge in immobile or debilitated patients, especially in hospital settings.

*Main Content:* Development begins with redness and progresses to ulceration if unrelieved. Risk factors include immobility, incontinence, malnutrition, and neuropathy. Prevention involves regular repositioning, use of pressure-relieving mattresses, and good skin care. Once established, management depends on the stage: superficial ulcers require dressings and hygiene, whereas deeper lesions may need debridement and occasionally flap coverage. Treating underlying medical conditions and improving nutrition are vital. Multidisciplinary input from nursing and physiotherapy teams helps minimize recurrence.

*Conclusion:* Vigilant prevention and early intervention are key to reducing morbidity from pressure sores, making them largely avoidable complications.


5. **Multiple discharging sinus in axilla (July, 2008)**

**Question:** Explain the causes and treatment of multiple discharging sinuses in the axilla.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Multiple sinuses in the axilla often result from chronic inflammatory conditions of the apocrine glands, most notably hidradenitis suppurativa. Bailey & Love emphasizes early management to prevent scarring and functional impairment.

*Main Content:* The condition begins with occlusion of hair follicles leading to recurrent abscess formation, which ruptures and forms fistulous tracts. Risk factors include obesity, smoking, and tight clothing. Management in early stages involves improving hygiene, weight reduction, and antibiotic therapy (e.g., clindamycin). Chronic disease with scarring may require surgical excision of the involved skin and subcutaneous tissue, sometimes followed by skin grafting. Adjunct measures include avoiding shaving or irritants and considering biologic therapy for severe refractory cases.

*Conclusion:* Early recognition and appropriate medical or surgical intervention can limit the morbidity associated with axillary hidradenitis and its discharging sinuses.


6. **Necrotizing fasciitis (July, 2008)**

**Question:** What is necrotizing fasciitis and how is it managed?

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection of the fascia leading to widespread tissue necrosis. Bailey & Love describes it as a surgical emergency requiring high clinical suspicion.

*Main Content:* The infection may be polymicrobial (Type I) or caused by group A Streptococcus (Type II). Early symptoms include severe pain out of proportion to skin findings, erythema, and swelling. Systemic toxicity rapidly develops. Diagnosis is largely clinical but can be supported by imaging such as MRI or CT showing fascial gas. Management involves immediate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics covering aerobes and anaerobes, aggressive surgical debridement of necrotic tissue, and supportive care in intensive settings. Delay in surgery greatly increases mortality.

*Conclusion:* Prompt recognition and radical debridement combined with appropriate antibiotics are critical to improving survival in necrotizing fasciitis.


7. **Sentinel node (July, 2008)**

**Question:** Define a sentinel lymph node and its role in cancer surgery.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* The sentinel lymph node is the first node in a regional lymphatic basin that drains a primary tumor site. Identifying this node helps surgeons determine the extent of cancer spread.

*Main Content:* In procedures such as breast cancer and melanoma surgery, a tracer dye or radioactive colloid is injected near the tumor to map lymphatic drainage. The sentinel node is then located using a handheld gamma probe or by visualizing the dye. Histological examination of this node allows accurate staging with minimal morbidity compared to full lymph node dissection. If the sentinel node is negative for metastasis, more extensive nodal surgery can often be avoided, sparing patients the risk of lymphedema and nerve injury.

*Conclusion:* Sentinel node biopsy provides critical staging information with reduced surgical burden and is now standard practice in many oncologic procedures.


8. **What are the problems of surgery in an obese patient (January, 2008)**

**Question:** Enumerate the problems associated with operating on an obese patient.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Obesity is increasingly common and poses numerous perioperative challenges. Bailey & Love notes that excess adipose tissue affects nearly every aspect of surgical care from anesthesia to wound healing.

*Main Content:* Intraoperatively, obese patients present difficulties with airway management and venous access. Higher intra-abdominal fat can obscure landmarks, prolonging operative time. They have increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory complications due to reduced lung volumes and cardiac strain. Post-operatively, wound infection and dehiscence rates are higher, and mobilization is often delayed, leading to deep vein thrombosis. Dosing of medications, especially anesthetics and antibiotics, requires adjustment. Careful planning, prophylactic anticoagulation, and the use of specialized equipment (such as longer instruments and bariatric operating tables) are essential.

*Conclusion:* Anticipating and addressing the unique needs of obese patients can significantly reduce perioperative morbidity and improve outcomes.


9. **Surgical ethics (January, 2008)**

**Question:** Summarize the key principles of surgical ethics.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Ethics in surgery guide decisions that affect patient wellbeing and professional integrity. Bailey & Love outlines fundamental principles that surgeons must uphold in daily practice.

*Main Content:* The four pillars of medical ethics—autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice—apply directly to surgery. Autonomy requires obtaining informed consent and respecting patient choices. Beneficence and non-maleficence obligate surgeons to act in the patient's best interest while avoiding unnecessary harm. Justice entails fair allocation of healthcare resources and unbiased treatment of all patients. Additional concerns include maintaining confidentiality, providing accurate information, and disclosing potential conflicts of interest. Surgeons must also adhere to professional guidelines, continuing education, and responsible research conduct.

*Conclusion:* Adherence to ethical principles fosters trust, ensures patient safety, and underpins the reputation of the surgical profession.


10. **Pain palliation in cancer patient (January, 2008)**

**Question:** Describe the approach to pain palliation in a cancer patient.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Effective pain control improves quality of life for cancer patients and is an integral part of oncologic management. Bailey & Love recommends a stepwise approach tailored to individual needs.

*Main Content:* The World Health Organization analgesic ladder guides pharmacologic therapy, beginning with non-opioid analgesics like paracetamol or NSAIDs. If pain persists, mild opioids such as codeine are added, progressing to strong opioids like morphine for severe pain. Adjuvant medications, including antidepressants or anticonvulsants, help in neuropathic pain. For refractory cases, interventions such as nerve blocks, epidural infusions, or spinal pumps may be considered. Non-pharmacologic measures—psychological support, physiotherapy, and complementary therapies—also play roles. Regular assessment of pain scores ensures adequate relief and helps adjust therapy.

*Conclusion:* A systematic, multidisciplinary approach is crucial for optimal pain palliation, respecting patient preferences and balancing efficacy with side effects.


11. **Post operative pulmonary complications (July, 2007)**

**Question:** List common postoperative pulmonary complications and preventive measures.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* Pulmonary complications remain a significant source of morbidity following surgery, particularly thoracic or upper abdominal procedures.

*Main Content:* Common problems include atelectasis, pneumonia, bronchospasm, and exacerbation of chronic lung disease. Risk factors include smoking, obesity, advanced age, and prolonged anesthesia. Prevention begins preoperatively by optimizing pulmonary function and encouraging smoking cessation. Intraoperatively, careful ventilation strategies and limiting operative time reduce risk. Postoperatively, early mobilization, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, and adequate analgesia are vital to maintain lung expansion. Chest physiotherapy and appropriate antibiotic use can manage or prevent pneumonia. Regular monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate allows prompt detection of deterioration.

*Conclusion:* A proactive approach combining preoperative optimization and vigilant postoperative care is essential to minimize pulmonary complications.


12. **ARDS (July, 2007)**

**Question:** Outline acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and its management.

**Answer**

*Introduction:* ARDS is a severe inflammatory lung injury characterized by acute onset of hypoxemia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Bailey & Love describes it as a critical care challenge often following sepsis or trauma.

*Main Content:* Diagnostic criteria include acute onset within one week of an insult, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than 300 despite adequate PEEP. Management focuses on treating the underlying cause and providing supportive ventilation. Low tidal volume ventilation (6 mL/kg of ideal body weight) prevents ventilator-induced lung injury, while higher PEEP improves oxygenation. Fluid management should avoid overload. Adjuncts may include prone positioning, neuromuscular blockade, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe cases. Mortality remains high despite advances.

*Conclusion:* Early recognition and lung-protective ventilation strategies are central to improving outcomes in ARDS patients.


13. **Rational use of antibiotics (July, 2007)**

**Question:** Describe the principles of rational antibiotic use.

**Answer**
